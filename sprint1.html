        <h4>I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned were
            current, if not more so, in the company i joined. I honestly feel i
            got every penny's worth.</h4>

            "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
            I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.
            I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
            The next 12 weeks was thhe best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course.
                I've succesfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at VR startup."

                    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
                    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
                    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

            <h4>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>
            <p>  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
                student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
                did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
                project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
                could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
                experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
                100% recommend! ”</p>
